                    service learning.&nbsp; While creating educational opportunities, the project also establishes socially and economically sustainable systems.<br><br>In July of 2017, during a visit to “The Institute for the Blind” in Khartoum, a collaboration
                    formed with a craft class which used making as a form of haptic learning for the blind and visually impaired.&nbsp; Despite a serious lack of materials, beautiful jewelry and accessories were made with a high level of craft. This was
                    possible through a profound energy between students and teachers, working together and teaching each other.&nbsp; In less than two weeks, the Art By Blind project formed, provided improved materials and resources to the class and established
                    a collaborative learning micro-economy.&nbsp; At the end of the visit, every piece the class made had already sold.&nbsp; The classes have sustained ever since, and the pieces have diversified into jewelry and other accessories.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Our
                    jewelry are made of natural agate gemstones.&nbsp; Agate is a stone of strength and a symbol of protection and harmony. It is also known for strengthening courage, protection, healing, calming, and balancing yin/yang energy.<br><br></p>
